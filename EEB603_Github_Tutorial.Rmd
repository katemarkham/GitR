##Aims of this tutorial
-Understand what GitHub is, and when and why you would use it
-Set up your own GitHub account, install Git, connect with RStudio


##Introduction
###What is GitHub
Git is a version control system for tracking files and collaborating with others. 

Version control is the management of changes to whatever (code, document, website, etc.). It's sort of like Track Changes in Microsoft Word but much better.

Github is the web-based hosting service for Git.

Git was started in 2005 originally for Linux. Github launched in 2008. 

###Why use Github/RStudio?
Manage evolution and changes of data files - reports, figures, code, data (i.e., repositories)

Allows others to see your work, adopt your code in their projects, or let others you are collaborating with make changes

Allows you to track your changes easily, don't need ten million versions saved on your computer/drive, can find changes you made months ago,  

It is FREE 

Pretty user-friendly

All the cool kids are doing it (seriously, take ecology out of the dark ages)

##Online

First register for a github account at www.github.com


##On your computer
###Install Git on your computer
*The best guide for this seems to be 'happygitwithr' by Jenny Bryan: http://happygitwithr.com/*

**Follow directions exactly.**
Noe that they differ for Mac, Windows, and other operating systems.

For PCs:
1. Open the Command Prompt
2. First, check that Git isn't already installed by typing in your command prompt:
where git
3. If you don't have Git, install it from this website: https://gitforwindows.org/ *Install Git into the Program Files folder on your C drive so RStudio can find it.
```{r figure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="What to Type in the Command Prompt", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("command_prompt_screenshot.PNG")
```
After the "GNU General Public License" , keep the default options for the next two screens, then for "Adjusting your PATH environment", select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt."
4. If you have Git installed, check the version by typing 
git --version
into your command prompt



###Start a Github/RStudio project
First, go to github.com and set up an account
Once your account is created, click + sign on top right > New Repository
Name the repository
Click to initialize with a README file
Click 'Create Repository'
Click green 'Clone or download' button
Click clipboard button next to URL
Next, open RStudio
File > New Project > Version Control > Git
Paste repository URL
This autofills project directory name
Pick a directory on your computer
Create project

##In R

###Load necessary R packages
```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
if(!require("installr")) install.packages("installr")
if(!require("knitr")) install.packages("knitr")
if(!require("knitcitations")) install.packages("knitcitations")
if(!require("bookdown")) install.packages("bookdown")
if(!require("kfigr")) install.packages("kfigr")



library("installr", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.4")
library(knitr)
library(knitcitations)
library(bookdown)
library(kfigr)
```

###Make sure your version of R is updated and current
```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
check.for.updates.R(notify_user = TRUE, GUI = TRUE,
   page_with_download_url = "https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/",
   pat = "R-[0-9.]+.+-win\\.exe")
```

###Connect RStudio with GitHub

##Glossary
**Branch**-Parallel version of a repository. Working on a branch allows you to work without changing the live version on the master branch.
**Clone**-Copy of a reposity that is on your machine rather than on the server. (Can also act as a verb.) You can sync changes in your cloned copy to remote versions when you are online.
**Commit**-Changes to a file. It's similar to a "save as"" but you do not need to rename the file (Git automatically keeps track of each change). 
**Fetch**-Grabbing the latest version from an online repository-does not automatically merge this version with your own. 
**Fork**-Your own copy of another user's repository that remains on your own account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original. You can pull updates from the original user's repository.
**Pull**-Grabs new changes and merges them with your own copies. If you need to grab new changes but not merge them, see "fetch."
**Push**- Send your changes to a remote repository. If you make changes and you want your collaborators to see them, you need to push your changes.
**Repository**-The place where all of the project's files are stored. A repository also records the file's revision history. Can be public or private and can have multuple collaborators.
